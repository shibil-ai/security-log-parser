# 🔐 Security Log Parser

This is a simple Python script that parses a sample `security.log` file and generates a summary of:

- 🔐 Failed Login Attempts
- 🚫 Unauthorized Access Attempts
- 🦠 Malware Detections

## 🧪 How It Works

1. Reads a sample log file
2. Analyzes each line for key security events
3. Counts occurrences and prints a summary
4. Saves the results to a text file

## 📁 Files

- `security.log` – Sample log input
- `output_summary.txt` – Generated summary report
- `security_log_parser.py` – (You can add later for actual parser script)
